# Qwen3-VL MoT on RoboDojo

## Runtime and checkpoint contract

Use branch `qwen3vl_mot_pretrained_generation`. The policy runs in `wam`;
Isaac Sim runs in a separate simulator environment. Do not install Isaac Sim
into the policy environment or change the shared RoboDojo/Pi_05 installation.

This integration targets RoboDojo's XPolicyLab WebSocket interface
(`update_obs`, `get_action`, `reset`, and their batched variants), not a
LIBERO/Gym interface. Upstream reference:
<https://github.com/robodojo-benchmark/RoboDojo>.

Local inputs:

| Input | Path |
|---|---|
| RoboDojo | `/data2/guoqi/robodojo_pi05_repro` |
| Simulation assets | `/data2/guoqi/robodojo_pi05_repro/Assets` |
| Experiment | `/data2/lizuolei/weights/qwen3vl_mot_weights/1016_ft_on_robodojo` |
| DCP checkpoint | Experiment's `step4k/model` directory |
| Qwen backbone | `/home/jianf/blob_data/pt_weights/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct` |
| Cosmos VAE | `/home/jianf/blob_data/pt_weights/Cosmos3-Edge` |
| Stage 1 text backbone | `/home/jianf/blob_data/pt_weights/siglip2-base-patch16-224` |
| Training metadata | `/home/jianf/blob_data/robot_dataset/lerobot-format-v30/RoboDojo/data/RoboDojo_ee_lerobot_v30_video/meta` |

The checkpoint uses Nano generation, embedding-space physical flow, three
cameras and joint video/action prediction. Native actions are **absolute
world-frame end-effector poses**, not joint targets or pose deltas. Both arms
use xyz + interleaved first-two rotation-matrix columns + gripper in canonical
slots 0:20; slots 20:40 are masked. RoboDojo native quaternions are wxyz.
Camera roles are primary=cam_high, secondary=cam_left_wrist,
wrist=cam_right_wrist. Source rate is 25 Hz.

Normalization must use `observation.ee_ort6d_pos` and `action.ee_ort6d_pos`
statistics from the training dataset, with the training standard-deviation
floor of 1e-3. The local copy under
`/data2/lizuolei/data/lerobot_data/simulation_data` lacks these statistics and
must **not** be substituted. Dataset `info.json` may retain its original 16D
quaternion features even though converted parquet and statistics contain the
20D ort6d fields.

## Policy environment

The existing `wam` environment is Python 3.12. From the repository root:

```bash
conda activate wam
python -m pip install torch==2.9.1 torchvision==0.24.1 \
  --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
python -m pip install -r lerobot/evaluation/requirements_robodojo_qwen3vl.txt
```

Use the repository directly from its root; installing all LeRobot training
and hardware extras is unnecessary for this inference service.

The local simulator environment is `RoboDojo6` (Isaac Sim 6.0.0.1 with its
matching IsaacLab). This is a local compatibility setup, not the public
Isaac Sim 5.1 benchmark runtime. Results must identify this difference.
